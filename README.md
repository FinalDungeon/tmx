tmx
===

This is an unofficial fork and python 3 port of the [pygame tmx library originally](https://bitbucket.org/r1chardj0n3s/pygame-tutorial/src/995c364f087cc24e20682f642b3b406e7e3dcdae/tmx.py) made by Richard Jones. 

Tmx is a powerful tmx-based tile engine for pygame that allows for simple and fast animating of tile based maps and/or sprites. Tmx maps can be eaisly developed and edited using a [GUI tilemap editor](http://www.mapeditor.org/). For more information on how to use a tilemap editor, [check out this tutorial](http://gamedev.tutsplus.com/tutorials/level-design/introduction-to-tiled-map-editor/).

I've decided to fork this so that people that would like to use python 3 to develop tiled based games will have access to compatible tools. If you'd still like to use python 2.x, you can use the [python 2.x branch](https://github.com/RenfredH04/tmx/tree/python2.x).
There is no offical doumentation for tmx yet, but you can view an example of pratical use of this library in my project, [pylletTown](https://github.com/RenfredH04/pylletTown) along with a [video of it working in action](http://youtu.be/KnOMXyqbxqY).

Installiation of the [pygame](http://www.pygame.org/install.html) and any version of [python3](http://www.python.org/getit/) is required to use tmx.
